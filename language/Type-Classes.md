# Type Classes

PureScript supports type classes via the `class` and `instance` keywords.

Types appearing in class instances are must be of the form `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, or `C t1 ... tn` where `C` is a type constructor (including `->` and `t_i` are types of the same form).

Type class instances are resolved based on the order in which they appeared in the source files. Overlapping instances are currently permitted but not recommended. In simple cases the compiler will display a warning and list the instances it found and which was chosen. In the future they may be disallowed completely.

Here is an example of the `Show` typeclass, with instances for `String`, `Boolean` and `Array`:

```purescript
class Show a where
  show :: a -> String

instance showString :: Show String where
  show s = s

instance showBoolean :: Show Boolean where
  show true = "true"
  show false = "false"

instance showArray :: (Show a) => Show (Array a) where
  show xs = "[" <> joinWith ", " (map show xs) <> "]"

example = show [true, false]
```

## Multi-Parameter Type Classes

TODO. For now, see the section in [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-multi-parameter-type-classes).

## Superclasses

Superclass implications can be indicated in a class declaration with a backwards fat arrow `<=`:

```purescript
class (Monad m) <= MonadFail m where
  fail :: forall a. String -> m a
```

This code example defines a `MonadFail` class with a `Monad` superclass: any type which defines an instance of `MonadFail` will be required to define an instance of `Monad` too.

Superclass instances will be used when searching for an instance of a subclass. For example, in the code below, the `Applicative` constraint introduced by the `pure` function can be discharged since `Applicative` is a superclass of `Monad`, which is in turn a superclass of `MonadFail`:

```purescript
assert :: forall m. (MonadFail m) => Boolean -> m Unit
assert true = pure unit
assert false = fail "Assertion failed"
```

## Orphan Instances

Type class instances which are defined outside of both the module which defined the class and the module which defined the type are called *orphan instances*. Some programming languages (including Haskell) allow orphan instances with a warning, but in PureScript, they are forbidden. Any attempt to define an orphan instance in PureScript will mean that your program does not pass type checking.

For example, the `Semigroup` type class is defined in the module `Data.Semigroup`, and the `Int` type is defined in the module `Prim`. If we attempt to define a `Semigroup Int` instance like this:

```purescript
module MyModule where

import Prelude

instance semigroupInt :: Semigroup Int where
  append = (+)
```

This will fail, because `semigroupInt` is an orphan instance. You can use a `newtype` to get around this:

```purescript
module MyModule where

import Prelude

newtype AddInt = AddInt Int

instance semigroupAddInt :: Semigroup AddInt where
  append (AddInt x) (AddInt y) = AddInt (x + y)
```

In fact, a type similar to this `AddInt` is provided in `Data.Monoid.Additive`, in the `monoid` package.

For multi-parameter type classes, the orphan instance check requires that the instance is either in the same module as the class, or the same module as at least one of the types occurring in the instance. (TODO: example)


## Functional Dependencies

TODO. For now, see the section in [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-functional-dependencies).

## Type Class Deriving

Some type class instances can be derived automatically by the PureScript compiler. To derive a type class instance, use the `derive instance` keywords:

```purescript
newtype Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }

derive instance eqPerson :: Eq Person
derive instance ordPerson :: Ord Person
```
Currently, the following type classes can be derived:

- [Data.Generic (class Generic)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-generics/3.3.0/docs/Data.Generic#t:Generic)
- [Data.Generic.Rep (class Generic)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-generics-rep/4.1.0/docs/Data.Generic.Rep#t:Generic)
- [Data.Eq (class Eq)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/2.4.0/docs/Data.Eq#t:Eq)
- [Data.Ord (class Ord)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/2.4.0/docs/Data.Ord#t:Ord)
- [Data.Functor (class Functor)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/2.4.0/docs/Data.Functor#t:Functor)
- [Data.Newtype (class Newtype)](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-newtype/1.3.0/docs/Data.Newtype#t:Newtype)

## Compiler-Solvable Type Classes

Some type classes can be automatically solved by the PureScript Compiler without requiring you place a PureScript statement, like `derive instance`, in your source code.

``` purescript
foo :: forall t. (Warn "Custom warning message") => t -> t
foo x = x
```

Currently, the following type classes can be automatically solved:

- `Warn`
- [`IsSymbol`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-typelevel-prelude/1.0.0/docs/Type.Data.Symbol#t:IsSymbol)
- [`CompareSymbol`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-typelevel-prelude/1.0.0/docs/Type.Data.Symbol#t:CompareSymbol)
- [`AppendSymbol`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-typelevel-prelude/1.0.0/docs/Type.Data.Symbol#t:AppendSymbol)
- `Union`, which computes the union of two rows of types
