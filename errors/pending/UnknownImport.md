I'm working through the "Getting Started Guide" at the beginning of chapter 3, and I get this error, which refer's me to this page?

```
$ pulp psci
Compiling PSCI.Support
Error found:
in module PSCI.Support
at /Users/globalkeith/code/ps/address-book/bower_components/purescript-psci-support/src/PSCI/Support.purs line 10, column 34 - line 10, column 53

  Cannot import value unsafeInterleaveEff from module Control.Monad.Eff.Unsafe
  It either does not exist or the module does not export it.

## remark
I was able to solve this by removing all dependencies from `bower.json` and then:

- `pulp build` to see the next *missing* dependency `abc`
- lookup the corresponding package to `abc`-> `purescript-xzy`
- `bower install --save purescript-xyz`
- rinse and repeat till it builds
