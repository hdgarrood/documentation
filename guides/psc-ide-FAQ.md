  1. install the `language-purescript` package
  2. install the `ide-purescript` package

# Troubleshooting

## Parsing the externs failed...

Step 1: Delete your `output/` folder and recompile your project

Step 2: Check if your `psc --version` and `psc-ide-server --version` match

Step 3: Check if you have an old psc-ide lying around (think stack, npm or cabal)

Step 4: Hop onto IRC and start a debugging session with @kritzcreek
