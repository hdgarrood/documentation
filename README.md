Welcome to the PureScript documentation repository!

PureScript is a small, strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
To get a better overview of PureScript, visit [The PureScript Website](http://purescript.org).

This repository is a collaborative effort, so please feel free to make a pull request to add/edit content or create an issue to discuss it. PureScript is a big project used by people coming from a variety of backgrounds. Making documentation useful to a wide variety of people is really hard to do well, requiring readers like you to point out and add documentation you feel is missing. Thanks for helping!

## Project Scope

Topics currently in this repository's scope:

- PureScript language reference documentation
- Its compiler errors
- Core concepts on which the language is based
- Introduction to package managers and dependency management
- Comparison with similar languages
- An introduction to other sources of documentation

Topics currently *not* in scope:

- Using PureScript libraries (those docs belong with the corresponding libraries)
- A PureScript language teaching course (use the [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) book or other resources)

Feel free to make an issue to discuss amending the scope.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](guides/Getting-Started.md): Download PureScript and build your first project
- [PureScript By Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read): A book about PureScript. Learn functional programming for the web by solving practical problems
- [Try PureScript](http://try.purescript.org): Try PureScript in your browser

## Learning

- The [PureScript Book](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) is the recommended approach to learning the language, since it covers more material in greater depth. However, it is not updated yet for the 0.12 version of the compiler.
