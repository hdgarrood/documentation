# PureScript 0.15 Migration Guide

## Tooling

- `purescript-psa` does not need to be updated.
- `spago` needs to be updated to `vT.B.D`.
- `pulp` needs to be updated to `v16.0.0`.
- `purs-tidy` needs to be updated to `vT.B.D`.

## ES modules migration guide

The biggest feature of PureScript `v0.15.0` is that PureScript code now compiles to ES modules, not CommonJS modules. We've dropped all support for CommonJS modules and only support ES modules.

* [How can I use Purescript v0.15 on Node.js?](#how-can-i-use-purescript-v015-on-nodejs)
* [How can I bundle my library or application?](#how-can-i-bundle-my-library-or-application)

### Context for why we are dropping CommonJS module support

In April, 2021 the Node.js LTS version 10 reached end-of-life, which was the last version that did not yet support ES modules (ESM). This means, that all Node.js LTS and current versions support ES modules. And since all major browsers have supported ESM for a long time, there is no need anymore in the JS ecosystem to support Common JS (CJS) and the JavaScript community is advocating to [drop CJS support](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/discussions/15). The JavaScript community is following suit and is dropping its support for CJS. Some notable examples are [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark#install), [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#commonjs) and [`framer-motion`](https://github.com/framer/motion) amongst many others.

### Welcome to Purescript v0.15 with ESM support!

Purescript v0.15 is here and supports ESM with all of its advantages:

* You can use ESM-only libraries
* A cleaner and simpler way of writing FFI
* Helping tools to do their job like [DCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination) or [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#code-splitting)

However, this has a couple of implications that will need you to migrate your code and tooling setup:

* v0.15 drops support of CJS

  With no real [reason](#context-for-why-we-are-dropping-commonjs-module-support) to keep supporting CJS, we have decided to drop CJS support alltogether. The maintenance burden would have been just too high to support CJS as well. This means you will need to update your FFI to ESM. More on this here:

  [How can I update CJS to ESM?](#how-can-i-update-cjs-to-esm)


* v0.15 drops support for Node.js versions < 12

  This is just the logical consequence of Node.js versions < 12 having reached EOL and not supporting ESM. More on this here:

  [How can I use Purescript on Node.js?](#how-can-i-update-cjs-to-esm)

* v0.15 drops `purs bundle` and relies on an external bundlers

  The Purescript compiler no longer comes with a built-in `bundle` command. `purs bundle` was already broken in a couple of ways, didn't do a great job on bundle size, and was basically unmaintained. Updating `purs bundle` to ESM would have required a considerable amount of work, taking time away from the compiler team to work on more urgent matters in the compiler.

  Therefore, v0.15 relies on an external bundler like `esbuild`, `webpack` or `parcel`. And that is good news because these tools are used industry-wide and do a much better job on bundling than `purs bundle`. You will see significantly improved bundle sizes with v0.15. Using [purescript-halogen template](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen-template), we get the following comparison:

  | Bundler         | Size |
  |--------------|-----------|
  | v0.14 with `purs bundle` | **259Kb** |
  | v0.14 with `purs-bundle` and `esbuild` | **110Kb** |
  | v0.15 with `esbuild` | **82Kb** |

  Another advantage is, that bundles are much more readable which facilitates debugging. Compare:

            console.log(s);
          };
        };

      })(PS["Effect.Console"] = PS["Effect.Console"] || {});

### How can I update CJS to ESM?

Automating this change works 95% of the time and is described in the _next_ section. _This_ section describes what changes need to be made in more detail.

Below are the most common changes to make:

* Importing a module

  In v0.14 you had to import a module using `require`

  ```javascript
  const mymodule = require('mymodule')
  ```

  In v0.15 you need to use `import`

  ```javascript
  import * as M from "mymodule";
  // or import specific items from the module
  import { main } from "mymodule";
  ```
* Exporting variables and functions in your FFI

  In v0.14 you had to use `exports`
  ```javascript
  exports.world = "ðŸ—º"
  exports.greet = function() { return "hello " + world }
  ```

  In v0.15 you need to use `export`
  ```javascript
  export const world = "ðŸ—º"

  export function greet() { return "hello " + world }

  // Here is the only example where you might need
  // to modify FFI by hand.
  //
  // Sometimes, defining the function and then exporting it under
  // a different name is needed to prevent issues with JavaScript
  // keywords. For example, we might use the below FFI
  // to export a function named `new`
  //    foreign import new :: Effect SomeObject
  const newImpl = function () { return new SomeObject; }
  export { newImpl as new };
  ```

Fortunately, there are tools that can automatically perform this conversion for you in most of the cases.

#### Automatically convert CJS to ESM

The best migration tool we have evaluated and recommend is [lebab](https://github.com/lebab/lebab). However, there are still two cleanup tasks one should run after using it. See the ["Migrate to ES Modules"](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-ecosystem-update/blob/master/markdown/migrateFFI.sh) script used in the ecosystem updates for inspiration.

The rest of this section covers `lebab` in a bit more detail:
```bash
npm i -g lebab

# Replace all *.js files in the src directory by rewriting them from
# CommonJS modules to ES modules
lebab --replace src --transform commonjs
lebab --replace test --transform commonjs

# you can also provide glob patterns, if you would like
lebab --replace 'src/js/**/*.jsx' --transform commonjs
```

The CommonJS â†’ ES modules transform is considered unsafe, because there are some edge cases the tool is unable to handle. Keep these issues in mind when using it to update your code:
https://github.com/lebab/lebab#unsafe-transforms

In general though it works well in most of the cases.

Another option you can try is [`cjstoesm`](https://github.com/wessberg/cjstoesm).

### How can I use Purescript v0.15 on Node.js?

Purescript v0.15 dropped support for Node.js versions below 12. If you are on an older version, you will need to upgrade to at least version 12.

To run your application, you can either use `spago run` or create an `index.js`

```javascript
// index.js
import { main } from 'output/Main/index.js'
main()
```

and run
```bash
node index.js
# or if you are on Node.js 12
node --experimental-modules index.js
```

### How can I bundle my library or application?

As discussed before, v0.15 drops support for `purs bundle` and therefore relies on an external bundler. We recommend three bundlers, namely [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/), [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) and [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/docs/). To make the transition easy for you, we have decided to make `spago bundle-app` and `spago bundle-module` use `esbuild` internally. The reasons for this are:

* the evaluated bundlers don't differ much in minified bundle size and are much better than the current purs-bundle
* `esbuild` outperforms the other bundlers when producing a "readable" bundle
* `esbuild` is a standalone tool that doesn't require npm or node
* `esbuild` doesn't require a config in comparison to webpack
* `esbuild` is way faster than the others

So you can keep using `spago` to bundle, but it requires you to install `esbuild`. More on this [later](#using-spago-to-bundle).

Nonetheless, the other two bundlers are also great options:
* [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) - has shown the best results in bundle size, but is also the slowest and most difficult to set up. If you need the smallest bundle size and full flexibility, this is probably the one you want.
* [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/docs/) - a good compromise between ease of use, speed and bundle size. If you need bundling involving html and css but still want a small, simple bundler, this is probably the one you want.

For a full discussion see [the github issue](https://github.com/working-group-purescript-es/challenges/issues/5).

#### Using `spago` to bundle

See [`spago` documentation](https://github.com/purescript/spago#bundle-a-project-into-a-single-js-file).

Basic usage:
```bash
spago bundle-app # bundle for the browser
spago bundle-app --platform node # bundle for node
spago bundle-app --minify # minified bundle for the browser
spago bundle-app --platform node --minify # minified bundle for node

spago bundle-module # bundle for the browser
spago bundle-module --platform node # bundle for node
spago bundle-module --minify # minified bundle for the browser
spago bundle-module --platform node --minify # minified bundle for node
```

#### Using `esbuild` to bundle

See [`esbuild` documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/).

Basic usage:
```bash
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=browser --outfile="bundle.js" # bundle for the browser
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=node --outfile="bundle.js" # bundle for node
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=browser --minify --outfile="bundle.minified.js" # minified bundle for the browser
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=node --minify --outfile="bundle.minified.js" # minified bundle for the node
```

#### Using `webpack` to bundle

See [`webpack` documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

Basic usage:
```bash
# Create webpack.config.js according to docs
webpack --mode=development # bundle
webpack --mode=production # minified bundle
```

#### Using `parcel` to bundle

See [`parcel` documentation](https://parceljs.org/docs/).

Basic usage:
```bash
# Note: in the examples below, the `index.html` file
# refers to a JavaScript file. If you are including your app
# as the entry point, it would have a script tag somewhere in it
# that looks something like this:
#   `<script type="module" src="./output/Main/index.js">`
parcel build index.html --no-source-maps --no-optimize --no-scope-hoist --dist-dir "dist/" # bundle for the browser
parcel build index.html --no-source-maps --dist-dir "dist/" # minified bundle for the browser
```

## Other Compiler Changes

### Support for type-level integers

A new kind `Int` was introduced that functions similar to the type-level `String` kind, `Symbol`. This allows cleaner syntax than the peano-based integers the community was using previously. Moreover, it allows easier representation of negative integers:
```purs
-- 0.14.x
data Nat
foreign import data Zero :: Nat
foreign import data Succ :: Nat -> Nat

type Two = Succ (Succ Zero)

addInts :: forall l r. Add l r total => Proxy l -> Proxy r -> Proxy total
addInts _ _ = Proxy

let x = addInts (Proxy :: Proxy (Succ (Succ Zero))) (Proxy :: Proxy (Succ Zero))
x == (Proxy :: Proxy (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))))
```
```purs
-- 0.15.x
type Two = 2

addInts :: forall l r. Add l r total => Proxy l -> Proxy r -> Proxy total
addInts _ _ = Proxy

let x = addInts (Proxy :: Proxy 2) (Proxy :: Proxy 1)
x == (Proxy :: Proxy 3)
```

The type-level functions for `+`, `*`, and `compare` are represented via the `Add`, `Mul` and `Compare` type classes in `Prim.Int`.

At this time, there is no type-level function for converting a type-level `Int` into a type-level `Symbol`.

### `Data.Reflectable`

There are now two kinds, `Symbol` and `Int`, that have first-class syntax support. While we could provide kind-specific reflection type classes (e.g. `IsSymbol` for `Symbol` and `IsInt` for `Int`), a kind-generic reflection type class is better since we also have polykinds support.

Thus, a new compiler-solved type class was introduced and can be referenced under the `Data.Reflectable` module namespace.

```purs
class Reflectable typeLevelType valueLevelType | typeLevelType -> valueLevelType where
  reflectType :: Proxy typeLevelType -> valueLevelType

-- Since this class is solved by compiler,
-- the below instances are illustrative, not exhaustive.
instance Reflectable 1 Int where
  reflectType _ = 1
instance Reflectable "foo" String where
  reflectType _ = "foo"
```

However, when reflecting type-level integers to their value-level counterpart, keep in mind that the JavaScript backend's `Int` type has limits. Reflecting a type-level integer that is outside of these limits to a value-level one will produce a runtime error.

In `v0.16.0`, we'll dropping the `IsSymbol` type class and centralizing on the `Reflectable` type class.


## Ecosystem changes

### Changes affecting multiple libraries

- Migrated all FFI to ES modules and dropped support for CommonJS modules.
- Removed all kind-specific Proxy types (e.g. `SProxy`, `Proxy2`, `Proxy3`, `RLProxy`, etc.)
    - Replace usage of such types with `Type.Proxy (Proxy(..))`.
- Removed `MonadZero` type class and all of its deprecated instances.

### `purescript-prelude` changes

- The data type, `NoConstructors`, often used in `Generic`-related code, was changed to newtype `Void`, enabling one to unwrap the newtype and use `absurd`.

### `purescript-ordered-collections`: update on `Map`'s `Semigroup` instance

This section has yet to be written. Below is what was written in the v0.14.x guide.

- Changes we will be making in future releases:
    - v0.14.0
        - `Data.Map.Unbiased` - added
        - `Data.Map`'s `Semigroup` instance unchanged but a deprecation notice is added, warning of future change
    - v0.15.0
      - `Data.Map.Unbiased` - deprecated
      - `Data.Map`'s `Semigroup` instance is changed to `Data.Map.Unbiased` implementation. A deprecation notice is still shown, warning of the change.
    - v0.16.0
      - `Data.Map.Unbiased` - removed
      - `Data.Map` - warning on `Semigroup` instance is removed

See [Unbiasing the Semigroup instance for Map](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/unbiasing-the-semigroup-instance-for-map/1935) and [purescript/purescript-ordered-collections#38](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-ordered-collections/pull/38) for more context.

### `purescript-foreign-object`'s `Semigroup` instance was changed

This section has yet to be written. Including here because it relates to the Map discussion above.
