# PureScript 0.15 Migration Guide

This guide summarizes the changes you may need to make to your code to migrate from PureScript 0.14 to PureScript 0.15. It covers major changes to the compiler, the core libraries, and tooling. For a detailed review of changes to the compiler in this release, please see the [compiler release notes for PureScript 0.15](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/releases/tag/v0.15.0).

Compiler releases are often accompanied by breaking changes in the core libraries. While some major library changes are described in this document, you should consult the individual changelogs for any libraries you depend on. See the [0.15 Ecosystem Update](./0.15-Ecosystem-Update.md) for an abbreviated consolidation of all changelog entries for the first `0.15.0` release of all `core`, `contrib`, `node`, and `web` libraries.

## Tooling

- `purescript-psa` does not need to be updated.
- `spago` needs to be updated to `v0.20.8`.
- `pulp` needs to be updated to `v16.0.0`.
- `purs-tidy`:
    - `0.7.2`, the latest version as of this writing, will only format your `0.15.0` code if you are not using type-level integers syntax.
    - A future release should address this issue.

## ES modules migration guide

The biggest feature of PureScript `v0.15.0` is that PureScript code now compiles to ES modules, not CommonJS modules. We've dropped all support for CommonJS modules and only support ES modules.

* [How can I update CJS to ESM?](#how-can-i-update-cjs-to-esm)
* [How can I use Purescript v0.15 on Node.js?](#how-can-i-use-purescript-v015-on-nodejs)
* [How can I bundle my library or application?](#how-can-i-bundle-my-library-or-application)

### Context for why we are dropping CommonJS module support

In April, 2021 the Node.js LTS version 10 reached end-of-life, which was the last version that did not yet support ES modules (ESM). This means, that all Node.js LTS and current versions support ES modules. And since all major browsers have supported ESM for a long time, there is no need anymore in the JS ecosystem to support Common JS (CJS) and the JavaScript community is advocating to [drop CJS support](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/discussions/15). The JavaScript community is following suit and is dropping its support for CJS. Some notable examples are [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/main/packages/remark#install), [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#commonjs) and [`framer-motion`](https://github.com/framer/motion) amongst many others.

### Welcome to Purescript v0.15 with ESM support!

Purescript v0.15 is here and supports ESM with all of its advantages:

* You can use ESM-only libraries
* A cleaner and simpler way of writing FFI
* Helping tools to do their job like [DCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code_elimination) or [Code-Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#code-splitting)

However, this has a couple of implications that will need you to migrate your code and tooling setup:

* v0.15 drops support of CJS

  With no real [reason](#context-for-why-we-are-dropping-commonjs-module-support) to keep supporting CJS, we have decided to drop CJS support alltogether. The maintenance burden would have been just too high to support CJS as well. This means you will need to update your FFI to ESM. More on this here:

  [How can I update CJS to ESM?](#how-can-i-update-cjs-to-esm)


* v0.15 drops support for Node.js versions < 12

  This is just the logical consequence of Node.js versions < 12 having reached EOL and not supporting ESM. More on this here:

  [How can I use Purescript on Node.js?](#how-can-i-update-cjs-to-esm)

* v0.15 drops `purs bundle` and relies on an external bundlers

  The Purescript compiler no longer comes with a built-in `bundle` command. `purs bundle` was already broken in a couple of ways, didn't do a great job on bundle size, and was basically unmaintained. Updating `purs bundle` to ESM would have required a considerable amount of work, taking time away from the compiler team to work on more urgent matters in the compiler.

  Therefore, v0.15 relies on an external bundler like `esbuild`, `webpack` or `parcel`. And that is good news because these tools are used industry-wide and do a much better job on bundling than `purs bundle`. You will see significantly improved bundle sizes with v0.15. Using [purescript-halogen template](https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen-template), we get the following comparison:

  | Bundler         | Size |
  |--------------|-----------|
  | v0.14 with `purs bundle` | **259Kb** |
  | v0.14 with `purs-bundle` and `esbuild` | **110Kb** |
  | v0.15 with `esbuild` | **82Kb** |

  Another advantage is, that bundles are much more readable which facilitates debugging. Compare:

### How can I update CJS to ESM?

Automating this change works 95% of the time and is described in the _next_ section. _This_ section describes what changes need to be made in more detail.

Below are the most common changes to make:

* Importing a module

  In v0.14 you had to import a module using `require`

  ```javascript
  const mymodule = require('mymodule')
  ```

  In v0.15 you need to use `import`

  ```javascript
  import * as M from "mymodule";
  // or import specific items from the module
  import { main } from "mymodule";
  ```
* Exporting variables and functions in your FFI

  In v0.14 you had to use `exports`
  ```javascript
  exports.world = "ðŸ—º"
  exports.greet = function() { return "hello " + world }
  ```

  In v0.15 you need to use `export`
  ```javascript
  export const world = "ðŸ—º"

  export function greet() { return "hello " + world }

  // Here is the only example where you might need
  // to modify FFI by hand.
  //
  // Sometimes, defining the function and then exporting it under
  // a different name is needed to prevent issues with JavaScript
  // keywords. For example, we might use the below FFI
  // to export a function named `new`
  //    foreign import new :: Effect SomeObject
  const newImpl = function () { return new SomeObject; }
  export { newImpl as new };
  ```

Fortunately, there are tools that can automatically perform this conversion for you in most of the cases.

#### Automatically convert CJS to ESM

The best migration tool we have evaluated and recommend is [lebab](https://github.com/lebab/lebab). However, there are still two cleanup tasks one should run after using it. See the ["Migrate to ES Modules"](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-ecosystem-update/blob/master/markdown/migrateFFI.sh) script used in the ecosystem updates for inspiration.

The rest of this section covers `lebab` in a bit more detail:
```bash
npm i -g lebab

# Replace all *.js files in the src directory by rewriting them from
# CommonJS modules to ES modules
lebab --replace src --transform commonjs
lebab --replace test --transform commonjs

# you can also provide glob patterns, if you would like
lebab --replace 'src/js/**/*.jsx' --transform commonjs
```

The CommonJS â†’ ES modules transform is considered unsafe, because there are some edge cases the tool is unable to handle. Keep these issues in mind when using it to update your code:
https://github.com/lebab/lebab#unsafe-transforms

In general though it works well in most of the cases.

Another option you can try is [`cjstoesm`](https://github.com/wessberg/cjstoesm).

### How can I use Purescript v0.15 on Node.js?

Purescript v0.15 dropped support for Node.js versions below 12. If you are on an older version, you will need to upgrade to at least version 12.

To run your application, you can either use `spago run` or create an `index.js`

```javascript
// index.js
import { main } from 'output/Main/index.js'
main()
```

and run
```bash
node index.js
# or if you are on Node.js 12
node --experimental-modules index.js
```

### How can I bundle my library or application?

As discussed before, v0.15 drops support for `purs bundle` and therefore relies on an external bundler. We recommend three bundlers, namely [`esbuild`](https://esbuild.github.io/), [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) and [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/docs/). To make the transition easy for you, we have decided to make `spago bundle-app` and `spago bundle-module` use `esbuild` internally. The reasons for this are:

* the evaluated bundlers don't differ much in minified bundle size and are much better than the current purs-bundle
* `esbuild` outperforms the other bundlers when producing a "readable" bundle
* `esbuild` is a standalone tool that doesn't require npm or node
* `esbuild` doesn't require a config in comparison to webpack
* `esbuild` is way faster than the others

So you can keep using `spago` to bundle, but it requires you to install `esbuild`. More on this [later](#using-spago-to-bundle).

Nonetheless, the other two bundlers are also great options:
* [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) - has shown the best results in bundle size, but is also the slowest and most difficult to set up. If you need the smallest bundle size and full flexibility, this is probably the one you want.
* [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/docs/) - a good compromise between ease of use, speed and bundle size. If you need bundling involving html and css but still want a small, simple bundler, this is probably the one you want.

For a full discussion see [the github issue](https://github.com/working-group-purescript-es/challenges/issues/5).

#### Using `spago` to bundle

See [`spago` documentation](https://github.com/purescript/spago#bundle-a-project-into-a-single-js-file).

Basic usage:
```bash
spago bundle-app # bundle for the browser
spago bundle-app --platform node # bundle for node
spago bundle-app --minify # minified bundle for the browser
spago bundle-app --platform node --minify # minified bundle for node

spago bundle-module # bundle for the browser
spago bundle-module --platform node # bundle for node
spago bundle-module --minify # minified bundle for the browser
spago bundle-module --platform node --minify # minified bundle for node
```

#### Using `esbuild` to bundle

See [`esbuild` documentation](https://esbuild.github.io/).

Basic usage:
```bash
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=browser --outfile="bundle.js" # bundle for the browser
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=node --outfile="bundle.js" # bundle for node
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=browser --minify --outfile="bundle.minified.js" # minified bundle for the browser
esbuild --bundle index.js --platform=node --minify --outfile="bundle.minified.js" # minified bundle for the node
```

#### Using `webpack` to bundle

See [`webpack` documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

Basic usage:
```bash
# Create webpack.config.js according to docs
webpack --mode=development # bundle
webpack --mode=production # minified bundle
```

#### Using `parcel` to bundle

See [`parcel` documentation](https://parceljs.org/docs/).

Basic usage:
```bash
# Note: in the examples below, the `index.html` file
# refers to a JavaScript file. If you are including your app
# as the entry point, it would have a script tag somewhere in it
# that looks something like this:
#   `<script type="module" src="./output/Main/index.js">`
parcel build index.html --no-source-maps --no-optimize --no-scope-hoist --dist-dir "dist/" # bundle for the browser
parcel build index.html --no-source-maps --dist-dir "dist/" # minified bundle for the browser
```

## Other Compiler Changes

### Support for type-level integers

A new kind `Int` was introduced that functions similar to the type-level `String` kind, `Symbol`. This allows cleaner syntax than the peano-based integers the community was using previously. Moreover, it allows easier representation of negative integers:
```purs
-- 0.14.x
data Nat
foreign import data Zero :: Nat
foreign import data Succ :: Nat -> Nat

type Two = Succ (Succ Zero)

addInts :: forall l r. Add l r total => Proxy l -> Proxy r -> Proxy total
addInts _ _ = Proxy

let x = addInts (Proxy :: Proxy (Succ (Succ Zero))) (Proxy :: Proxy (Succ Zero))
x == (Proxy :: Proxy (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))))
```
```purs
-- 0.15.x
type Two = 2

addInts :: forall l r. Add l r total => Proxy l -> Proxy r -> Proxy total
addInts _ _ = Proxy

let x = addInts (Proxy :: Proxy 2) (Proxy :: Proxy 1)
x == (Proxy :: Proxy 3)
```

The type-level functions for `+`, `*`, and `compare` are represented via the `Add`, `Mul` and `Compare` type classes in `Prim.Int`.

At this time, there is no type-level function for converting a type-level `Int` into a type-level `Symbol`.

### `Data.Reflectable`

There are now two kinds, `Symbol` and `Int`, that have first-class syntax support. While we could provide kind-specific reflection type classes (e.g. `IsSymbol` for `Symbol` and `IsInt` for `Int`), a kind-generic reflection type class is better since we also have polykinds support.

Thus, a new compiler-solved type class was introduced and can be referenced under the `Data.Reflectable` module namespace.

```purs
class Reflectable typeLevelType valueLevelType | typeLevelType -> valueLevelType where
  reflectType :: Proxy typeLevelType -> valueLevelType

-- Since this class is solved by compiler,
-- the below instances are illustrative, not exhaustive.
instance Reflectable 1 Int where
  reflectType _ = 1
instance Reflectable "foo" String where
  reflectType _ = "foo"
```

However, when reflecting type-level integers to their value-level counterpart, keep in mind that the JavaScript backend's `Int` type has limits. Reflecting a type-level integer that is outside of these limits to a value-level one will produce a runtime error.

In `v0.16.0`, we'll dropping the `IsSymbol` type class and centralizing on the `Reflectable` type class.

### Changes affecting operator sections: `(_ * 4 + 1)`

Operator sections only work when used with a single function. For example, `( _ + 1)` works because it "desugars" to `add 1`. `(foo _.bar)` does not because it "desugars" to `(foo <<< _.bar)`.

In `0.14.x`, operator sections involving multiple operators didn't desugar according to those operator precedence.
```purs
-- 0.14.x
(_ * 4 + 1) == (\x -> x * (4 + 1)) -- desugared wrong, but still compiled
            -- because it "desugars" to
            -- (mul (4 + 1) _)

(3 * 2 + _) -- failed to compile due to desugaring to
            -- (\x -> 3 * (2 + x))
            -- which is equivalent to
            -- (mul 3 <<< add 2)

-- 0.15.x
(_ * 4 + 1) -- fails to compile now since it desugars it correctly
            -- (\x -> (x * 4) + 1)
            -- which is equivalent to
            -- (add 1 <<< mul 4)
(3 * 2 + _) == (\x -> 3 * 2 + x) -- desugars correctly and compiles now
--          == (\x -> (3 * 2) + x)
            -- which is equivalent to
            -- (add (3 * 2))
```

If you have code that relied on the old behavior, add an extra pair of
parentheses around the expression in the section (i.e. the `_` part).

### Deprecation Warnings and Errors

#### `0.14.x` deprecation warnings now produce errors

See the [PureScript 0.15 release notes](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/releases/tag/v0.14.0) for how to migrate properly, but most should have accounted for these changes by now:
- deprecation warning for constraints in FFI syntax: `foreign import f :: forall a. Show a => a -> String`
- deprecation warning for old row kind syntax: `#`
- deprecation warning for old kind syntax (e.g imports, exports, declarations)

#### `0.15.x` introduces one new deprecation warning

A few years ago, PureScript changed how its parser worked. To ease migration, some ad-hoc indentation-reltaed `case _ of` syntax was supported awkwardly. This ad-hoc syntax is now being removed. The fix is easy: just indent past the binder.

```purescript
-- 0.14.x
-- `valid` indicates an indentation level
-- where the case branch's expression
-- could appear and the code would
-- still compile...
case foo of
      Foo arg -> {-
      |
      |
    valid
     valid
      valid
       valid
        valid...    -}
```
```purescript
-- 0.14.x
-- `invalid` indicates an indentation level
-- where an appearance of `arg` will cause
-- this deprecation waring to appear:
-- where an appearance of the case
-- branch's expression will cause
-- a compiler error
case foo of
      Foo arg -> {-
      |
      |
  invalid
    invalid
      invalid
       firstValidPlace
        conventionalValidPlace      -}
```

## Ecosystem changes

### Changes affecting multiple libraries

- Migrated all FFI to ES modules and dropped support for CommonJS modules.
- Removed all kind-specific Proxy types (e.g. `SProxy`, `Proxy2`, `Proxy3`, `RLProxy`, etc.)
    - Replace usage of such types with `Type.Proxy (Proxy(..))`.
- Removed deprecated `MonadZero` type class and all of its deprecated instances.

### Removal of deprecated things and their replacements

**To fix**:
- purescript-arrays
    - update `Data.Array.group'` to `Data.Array.groupAll`
    - update `Data.Array.NonEmpty.group'` to `Data.Array.NonEmpty.groupAll`
    - update `Data.Array.ST.empty` to `Data.Array.ST.new`
- purescript-lists
    - update `Data.List.group'` to `Data.List.groupAll`
    - update `Data.List.NonEmpty.group'` to `Data.List.NonEmpty.groupAll`
    - update `Data.List.mapWitIndex` to `Data.Foldable.mapWithIndex`
- purescript-free
    - replace `unfoldCofree e n` with `buildCofree (\s -> Tuple (e s) (n s))`
- purescript-validation
    - replace `Data.Validation.Semigroup.unV` with `Data.Validation.Semigroup.validation`
    - replace `Data.Validation.Semiring.unV` with `Data.Validation.Semiring.validation`

### Renamed entities

- purescript-css
  - replace `import CSS.Display (table)` with `import CSS.Display (displayTable)`
- purescript-parsing
  - All modules in this repo starting with `Text.Parsing` or `Text.Parsing.Parser` were renamed to just `Parsing`:
      - `Text.Parsing.Indent` -> `Parsing.Indent`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser` -> `Parsing.Parser`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.Combinators` -> `Parsing.Combinators`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.Expr` -> `Parsing.Expr`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.Language` -> `Parsing.Language`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.String` -> `Parsing.String`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.String.Basic` -> `Parsing.String.Basic`
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.Token` -> `Parsing.Token`
  - The `Pos` module was renamed but the module itself is being deprecated (it currently re-exports `Parsing`):
      - `Text.Parsing.Parser.Pos` -> `Parsing`
  - The below combinators originally in the `Text.Parsing.Parser.String` module were relocated to `Parsing.String.Basic` because they are combinators, not primitive parsers:
    - `whitespace`
    - `skipSpaces`
    - `oneOf`
    - `noneOf`
    - `oneOfCodePoints`
    - `noneOfCodePoints`

### `groupAllBy` replaced equality function with ordering function (`purescript-lists`)

```diff
- groupAllBy :: forall a. Ord a => (a -> a -> Boolean)  -> List a -> List (NEL.NonEmptyList a)
+ groupAllBy :: forall a.          (a -> a -> Ordering) -> List a -> List (NEL.NonEmptyList a)
```

**To fix**:
- use `compare`
- use <code>compare `on` comparisonFunction</code>

### Changes involving `purescript-affjax`

Affjax worked on the Node.js and browser environments by relying on a `require`
statement within a function. Depending on the environment detected,
either `XHR` or `XmlHttpRequest` is used. Since ES modules do not allow
one to call `import` within a function in a _synchronous_ way,
we cannot continue to use this approach.

Rather, all request-related functions (e.g. `request`, `get`, etc.) now take
as their first argument an `AffjaxDriver` value. Different environments
will pass in their implementation for that driver and re-export
the functionality defined in `affjax`. Rather than relying upon
`affjax` directly, end-users will now rely upon a library that defines
the driver and re-exports all the request-related functions from `Affjax`
with that environment's driver already applied. In other words,
you will only need to update the imported module, nothing else.

**To Fix**:
- If on Node.js...
  - `spago install affjax-node`
  - Update `import Affjax as AX` to `import Affjax.Node as AN`
- If on the brower...
  - `spago install affjax-web`
  - Update `import Affjax as AX` to `import Affjax.Web as AW`

### Changes involving `<|>`/`Control.Alt.alt` (`purescript-control`, `purescript-parsing`, `purescript-string-parser`)

Previously, `<|>` was left-associative. It is now right-associative. See [the issue](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-control/issues/79) for more context, but the change improves performance without breaking the `Alt` laws.

As a result of this change, some operators often used with `<|>` had to change their direction or their precedence to prevent a compiler error:
- purescript-parsing:
  - `<??>` became right-associative
  - `<?>` and `<~?>` precedence was dropped from 3 to 4
- purescript-string-parsers:
  - `<?>` was dropped from 3 to 4

**To fix**:
- If you experience an issue with an operator, you may need to change the precedence of that operator or its direction.

### `purescript-math` was deprecated; code ported to `numbers` and `integers`

`math` was tied too closely to the JavaScript backend. Now that we have the `numbers` and `integers` repo, we ported `math` to `numbers` and updated `integers` accordingly. we're deprecating `math` and deferring to those libraries.

**To fix**:
```diff
- import Math as Math
+ import Data.Number as Number

- foo = Math.pow
+ foo = Number.pow
```

### Generic code's `NoConstructors` now newtypes `Void` (`purescript-prelude`)

The data type, `NoConstructors`, often used in `Generic`-related code, was changed to newtype `Void`, enabling one to unwrap the newtype and use `absurd`.

This is not a breaking change, but authors of `Generic`-related libraries can now define type class instances for `NoConstructors` via `absurd`.

**To fix**:
- No changes need to be made

### `signum zero` returns `zero` (`purescript-prelude`)

This was an oversight that has finally been fixed. Previously, it would return `one`, unlike practically every other implementation in other languages.

**To fix**:
- Check your usage of `signum` in case you were relying on the old behavior

### `show`ing Records with duplicate labels fails to compile (`purescript-prelude`)

`Record.union` defers the need for a `Nub` constraint to help type inference in some cases. Since `Record`'s `Show` instance didn't add a `Nub` constraint, the below code would compile on `0.14.x`
```
let
  duplLabels :: { x :: String, x :: Int }
  duplLabels = union { x: "a" } { x: 2 }
in show duplLabels
```

A `Nub` constraint was added to `Show`, preventing the above example from compiling.

**To fix**:
- If you get compiler errors, figure out where a `Nub` constraint is needed.

### `purescript-ordered-collections`: update on `Map`'s `Semigroup` instance

- v0.15.0
  - `Data.Map.Unbiased` - instances left untouched
  - `Data.Map`'s `Semigroup` instance is changed to `Data.Map.Unbiased` implementation. A deprecation notice is still shown, warning of the change.
- Planned for v0.16.0
  - `Data.Map.Unbiased` - deprecate type and its instances
  - `Data.Map` - warning on `Semigroup` instance is removed
- Planned for `v0.17.0`
  - `Data.Map.Unbiased` - removed

See [Unbiasing the Semigroup instance for Map](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/unbiasing-the-semigroup-instance-for-map/1935) and [purescript/purescript-ordered-collections#38](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-ordered-collections/pull/38) for more context.

### Update `frequency` to use `NonEmptyArray` (`purescript-quickcheck`)

In the `0.14.x` ecosystem update, `oneOf` was changed from using a `NonEmptyList` to using a `NonEmptyArray` due to the better syntax support of arrays. However, `frequency` was not also updated. This change fixes that.

**To fix**:

```

### Drop `Maybe` wrapper and bounds check in `slice` (`purescript-strings`)

`Data.String.CodeUnits.slice` no longer does a bounds check. As such, it no longer returns `Maybe String`, but just `String`.
```purs
-- 0.14.x
slice 0 10 "0123" == Nothing
slice (-1) 10 "0123" == Nothing

-- 0.15.x
slice 0 10 "0123" == "0123"
slice (-1) 10 "0123" == "3"
```

**To fix**:
- Account for the lack of `Maybe`
- Check whether your args are passing in negative indices

## Breaking Changes in the `purescript-contrib` libraries

### Make `launchAff_` only work on `Aff Unit` (`purescript-aff`)

`launchAff_ :: forall a. Aff a -> Effect Unit` will _silently_ discard what the `Aff` computation returns. This behavior isn't always desirable, but the developer won't know otherwise.

Thus, `launchAff_`'s type signature was changed to `Aff Unit -> Effect Unit`. By making this change, developers are forced to clarify whether they want this discarding behavior or not. It's a minor annoyance (and breaking change) for most developers but otherwise makes the resulting code much safer.

**To fix**:
- If the "discarding" behavior is desired, replace `launchAff_ do` with `launchAff_ $ void do`
- If undesired, now you know where to fix your code

### Miscellaneous breakage in `purescript-css`

- In [purescript-css#140](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-css/pull/140), support for `calc` expressions was added, but the change affected the names and number of various constructors. See the PR for more info.
- In [purescript-css#88](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-css/pull/88), the `box-shadow` implementation was updated to reflect `Clay`, the original inspiration for the library. See the PR for more info.

### `Color.Scheme.*` modules were removed (`purescript-css`)

These colors, usually under the `Color.Scheme.*` module name space were originally defined in `purescript-colors` (i.e. one module per scheme). A PR (linked below) removed them because each scheme should be defined as its own library. The 'scheme drop' change propagated to this release.

See [purescript-contrib/purescript-colors#44](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-colors/pull/44) for original definitions of various colors.

**To Fix**:
- If needed immediately, copy the color scheme file into your local project
- Consider maintaining these files as separate libraries in the community

### Miscellaneous breaking change involving `purescript-parsing`
#### `ParserT` got (up to) 20x performance boost

`ParserT` now has a more efficient representation. In addition to the performance, all parser execution is always stack-safe, even monadically, obviating the need to run parsers with `Trampoline` as the base Monad or to explicitly use `MonadRec`.

Code that was parametric over the underlying Monad no longer needs to propagate a Monad constraint.

Code that constructs parsers via the underlying representation will need to be updated, but otherwise the interface is unchanged and parsers should just enjoy the speed boost.

**To fix**:
- Changes only needed if you depend on `ParserT`'s underlying representation

### Combinator `fooRec` can be replaced with `foo` version

Now that `ParserT` is stack-safe automatically, we no longer need functions that impose the `MonadRec` constraint. As such, all combinators ending in `Rec` due to the `MonadRec` constraint have been removed. The complete list is below:
- `chainlRec` -> `chainl`
- `chainl1Rec` -> `chainl1`
- `chainrRec` -> `chainr`
- `chainr1Rec` -> `chainr1`
- `endByRec` -> `endBy`
- `endBy1Rec` -> `endBy1`
- `many1Rec` -> `many1`
- `manyTillRec` -> `manyTill`
- `manyTillRec_` -> `manyTill_`
- `many1TillRec` -> `many1Till`
- `many1TillRec_` -> `many1Till_`
- `sepByRec` -> `sepBy`
- `sepBy1Rec` -> `sepBy1`
- `sepEndByRec` -> `sepEndBy`
- `sepEndBy1Rec` -> `sepEndBy1`
- `skipManyRec` -> `skipMany`
- `skipMany1Rec` -> `skipMany1`

Combinators that were defined in the module `Text.Parsing.Parser.Combinators` are now defined in `Parsing.Combinators`.

**To fix:**
- drop the `Rec` part of the combinator name and update imports
### `MonadState` is actually usable now

Previously, `ParserT`'s `MonadState` instance hardcoded the `state` type to `ParserState`. If one wanted to run the parser in the context of their own state monad, they could not do so.

This limitation has been removed, enabling more powerful parsers.

If you still need to get the state of the parser, you must replace `get` with `getParserT`

**To fix:**
- if depending on the underlying implementation, replace `get` with `getParserT`

### `regex` now reuses the implementation from `strings`

Previously, the `regex` function would use its own custom implementation. This functionality is already exposed in the `strings` package, so the function was updated to reuse that functionality:

```purs
-- old way
foo = do
  result <- regex { dotAll: true, global: true, ... } "finding a p[aA]ttern"

-- new way
import Data.String.Regex (dotAll, global)

foo = do
  eitherErrOrResult <- regex "finding a p[aA]ttern" (dotAll <> global)
  case eitherErrOrResult of
    Left e -> -- invalid regex
    Right result -> -- usage
```

Key differences are:
- the arguments order is swapped
- multiple flags are specified via a `Semigroup` rather than a `Record`
- the caller is forced to handle a possible error if the regex is invalid

**To fix**:
- use the "old way, new way" example above to update your code

### `Position` now has an `index` field

`index` is a line/column-independent position within the content being parsed. See the docs and implementation for more details.

**To fix**:
- If relying on this internal detail, update your code to account for it.

## Breaking Changes in the `purescript-node` libraries

### Expose the `Error` arg to `Stream.write`/`Stream.writeString (`purescript-node-streams`)

The `Stream.write` and `Stream.writeString` have a callback function. The type signature for this binding was inaccurate because an `Error` arg is passed to that function but the type signature is `Effect Unit` rather than `Error -> Effect Unit`.

This type signature was updated to be more accurate
```diff
-write :: forall r. Writable r -> Buffer ->           Effect Unit  -> Effect Boolean
+write :: forall r. Writable r -> Buffer -> (Error -> Effect Unit) -> Effect Boolean
```

**To fix**:
- if you want to keep your current behavior, wrap your `Effect Unit` code in `const` (e.g. `pure unit` -> `const $ pure unit`)
- if you want to use the `Error` arg, you can use `\err -> ...`

### Expose the `recursive` field in `mkdir'`'s options arg (`purescript-node-fs`/`purescript-node-fs-aff`)

Previously, `mkdir` did not expose all the fields in the options arg. So, trying to run something like `mkdir "foo/bar/baz" { recursive: true }` wasn't possible without writing your own FFI to `mkdir`. The `recursive` option has now been exposed.

**To fix**:
- update `mkdir' path perms` to `mkdir' path { recursive: false, mode: perms }`
- to get just the recursive behavior, use `mkdir' path { recursive: true, mode: mkPerms all all all }`

### Remove `Async.exists` (`purescript-node-fs`)

The async `exists` version from `purescript-node-fs` has been removed since the underlying Node.js version has been deprecated since Node.js version 1.

**To fix**:
- use `exists` from the `Sync` module

### Remove `exists` (`purescript-node-fs-aff`)

`exists` has been removed since the underlying `Async.exists` from `purescript-node-fs` has been removed.

**To fix**:
- import the `node-fs` package's `Node.Fs.Sync (exists)` function and wrap in `liftEffect` (e.g. `liftEffect $ Sync.exists path`)

## Breaking Changes in the `purescript-web` libraries

### `Arc` record type includes field for representing arc direction (`purescript-canvas`)

An arc could only be drawn clockwise due to an options field not being exposed in the FFI bindings. This change exposes that option.

```diff
- type Arc = { ... }
+ type Arc = { ..., useCounterClockwise :: Boolean }
```

**To fix**:
- To just migrate code, set `useCounterClockwise` to false
- To get the new counter-clockwise behavior , set `useCounterClockwise` to true

### `Transform` record type's fields renamed (`purescript-canvas`)

The `Transform` field names were changed because the values referenced by `m31` and `m32` corresponded to `dX` and `dY` in other contexts. MDN docs would use fields `a-f` to refer to the values in a context-agnostic way.

```diff
- { m11, m12, m21, m22, m31, m32 }
+ {   a,   b,   c,   d,   e,   f }
```
**To fix**:
- Update field names

### Arg order for `CSSStyleDeclaration` functions changed (`purescript-cssom`)

By convention, the "thing being operated on" occurs last in functions that take multiple arguments.Functions involving `CSSStyleDeclaration` now put the `CSSStyleDeclaration` arg last.

**To Fix**:
- `setCssText style str` -> `setCssText str style`
- `getPropertyPriority style str` -> `getPropertyPriority str style`
- `getPropertyValue style str` -> `getPropertyValue str style`
- `removeProperty style key` -> `removeProperty key style`
- `setProperty style key name` -> `setProperty key name style`

### Remove `Effect` wrapper for `doctype` (`purescript-web-dom`)

`doctype` is a readonly value that doesn't change. Thus, the `Effect` that wraps the returned value isn't needed and was dropped.

**To fix**:
```diff
foo = do
- ty <- doctype =<< document =<< window
+ ty <- doctype <$> document =<< window
```

### `getBoundingClientRect` type change and location change (`purescript-web-html`, `purescript-web-dom`)

`getBoundingClientRect` was moved from `web-html` to `web-dom`. Moreover, its arg was changed from `HTMLElement` to `Element`, enabling it to work on more types.

**To fix**:
```diff
- import Web.HTML.HTMLElement (getBoundingClientRect)
+ import Web.DOM.Element (getBoundingClientRect)

foo = do
- getBoundingClientRect $ toHtmlElement someElem
+ getBoundingClientRect $ toHtmlElement someElem
```

### `setClassName`/`getClassName`/`classList` deduplicated (`purescript-web-html`, `purescript-web-dom`)

These three functions were defined in `purescript-web-dom` and duplicated in their definitions in `purescript-web-html`, which depends on `purescript-web-dom`. Thus, They've been removed from `purescript-web-html`.

**To fix**:
```diff
- import Web.HTML.HTMLElement (setClassName, getClassName, classList)
+ import Web.DOM.Element (setClassName, getClassName, classList)
```

## Other Recommendations

### Discouraging usage of `F` and `FT`

**To fix:**
- no changes needed; this is simply a recommendation

In `purescript-foreign`, the `F` and `FT` type aliases often do more harm than good. The API has been updated to use those aliases' definitions rather than the aliases themselves.

While this doesn't count as a breaking change, nor are we deprecating those type alises, we encourage people to migrate their usage of it for clarity:
```diff
- import Foreign (F, FT)
+ import Foreign (ForeignError(..))
+ import Data.List.Types (NonEmptyList(..))

- type Foo = F a
+ type Foo = Except (NonEmptyList ForeignError) a

- type FooT = FT a
+ type FooT = ExceptT (NonEmptyList ForeignError) m a
```
